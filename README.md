## The Ultimate Scrolling Text Marquee Control \!\!\!\!


</div>

### Description

This is a complete drop in ActiveX control for the sole purpose of providing a simple way for you to scroll text "marquee" style. This control will allow you to scroll both vertical and horizontal, adjust the scroll rate, the number of times it repeats, load the text to scroll from a file, or build it dynamically. It will wordwrap your text if you want it to. You can align the scrolling text right, left, or center. It gives support for a "drop shadow" effect. You can specify the direction of the drop shadow either northwest, northeast, southeast, or southwest. You can choose your colors for the background, font and drop shadow. I've even included a property page with this control to make life even simpler for you.<br><br>

This control was developed in VB6, so you will need the VB6 runtimes in order to make it work properly.<br><br>

If you like this control, please rate it as I would really dig a copy of Ian's Help generator :-)<br><br>

This control is based on a previous example submited by "Steve" (I assume of VBTutor.com) located <a href="http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/default.asp?lngCId=4760&lngWId=1&blnFrm=false">Here</a>
